## 📘 Content Points

### 🌟 Your First Python Script: "Hello, World!"

Starting with Python is incredibly simple. The first program traditionally printed in any programming language is the "Hello, World!" program. You can add the Python code for this section later.
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
### 🏃‍♀️ How to Run a Python Script

To run your Python script:

1. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `hello_world.py`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello_world.py`.
4. Type `python hello_world.py` and press Enter.

Your script should run, and you should see `Hello, World!` printed to the console.

### 🎹 Introduction to Python REPL

Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive shell for Python. You can quickly test out code and experiment with Python syntax. To start the Python REPL, open your terminal or command prompt and type `python`, then press Enter.
