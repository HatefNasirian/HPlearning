## üßÆ Day 13-14: Operators ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñ‚ûó

### üéØ Objective: Learn How to Use Basic Operators

Operators in Python are the constructs that can manipulate the value of operands. They play a pivotal role in performing operations like addition, comparison, assignment, and more. This two-day module will give you a deep-dive into various kinds of operators in Python.

### üìò Content Points:

#### ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñ‚ûó Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

- `+`: Addition
- `-`: Subtraction
- `*`: Multiplication
- `/`: Division
- `%`: Modulus (remainder)
- `//`: Floor division
- `**`: Exponentiation

```python
# Arithmetic Operators Example
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Output: 13
print(a - b)  # Output: 7
print(a * b)  # Output: 30
print(a / b)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335
print(a % b)  # Output: 1
print(a // b) # Output: 3
print(a ** b) # Output: 1000
```

#### üîÑ Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- `=`: Assign
- `+=`: Add and assign
- `-=`: Subtract and assign
- `*=`: Multiply and assign
- `/=`: Divide and assign
- `%=`: Modulus and assign
- `//=`: Floor divide and assign
- `**=`: Exponentiate and assign

```python
# Assignment Operators Example
a = 10
a += 2  # Same as a = a + 2
a -= 3  # Same as a = a - 3
a *= 4  # Same as a = a * 4
# (continue with other assignment operators)
```

#### ü§î Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values and return a Boolean (True or False).

- `==`: Equal to
- `!=`: Not equal to
- `<`: Less than
- `>`: Greater than
- `<=`: Less than or equal to
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to

```python
# Comparison Operators Example
x = 5
y = 10
print(x == y)  # Output: False
print(x != y)  # Output: True
print(x < y)   # Output: True
print(x > y)   # Output: False
```

#### ü§ñ Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

- `and`: Both conditions must be True
- `or`: At least one condition must be True
- `not`: Reverses the Boolean value

```python
# Logical Operators Example
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)  # Output: False
print(a or b)   # Output: True
print(not a)    # Output: False
```

### üìù Assignment:

#### Create a Basic Calculator Using Python Operators
```python
a = input("Enter A:") #it will put input number inside A variable
print("mult= "+ (a + b))
```
Your task is to write a Python program that functions as a basic calculator. This calculator should be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.
