# üîÑ Day 11-12: Type Conversion

## üéØ Objective: Learn to Convert Between Different Data Types

One of the most practical skills in Python programming is the ability to convert data from one type to another. This
process is known as type conversion or typecasting. It enables you to transform the data into a format that can be more
suitable for specific operations, calculations, or conditions.

### Implicit Type Conversion

Python is smart enough to automatically perform type conversion in certain cases. This is known as implicit type
conversion or coercion. For instance, if you add an integer and a floating-point number, Python will convert the integer
to a float before performing the addition.

### Explicit Type Conversion

There are situations where you must explicitly instruct Python to change a data type. This is achieved using built-in
functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, and `bool()`.

Mastering type conversion will significantly enhance your capability to manipulate data effectively and broaden the range of problems you can solve using Python.

### ‚ÜïÔ∏è Implicit and Explicit Type Conversion

Type conversion is the practice of converting data from one form to another. In Python, this can happen in two ways: implicitly and explicitly.

#### Implicit Type Conversion

In implicit type conversion, Python does the work for you. For instance, if you add an integer to a float, Python will automatically convert the integer to a float so that the addition can be carried out.

```python
# Implicit Conversion Example
num1 = 3  # Integer
num2 = 4.5  # Float
result = num1 + num2  # Integer is converted to float
print(type(result) + result)  # Output: Float: 7.5
```
#### Explicit Type Conversion
Sometimes, you need to manually convert data types. For that, Python provides built-in functions like int(), float(), and str().
```python
# Explicit Conversion Example
string_num = "10"
int_num = int(string_num)  # String is converted to integer
print("Integer:", int_num)  # Output: Integer: 10
```
